                        <p id="inst">To prepare Nasi Goreng, start by heating cooking oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add minced garlic and chopped shallots or onions, sautéing until fragrant and lightly golden. If using, add diced chicken, shrimp, or your preferred protein, cooking until it's cooked through. Push the protein to the side of the skillet and crack eggs into the empty space, scrambling them until cooked.

Next, add cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps and stirring to combine with the protein and eggs. Pour in kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), soy sauce, and other optional sauces like fish sauce or oyster sauce for added depth of flavor. Toss everything together thoroughly, ensuring the rice is evenly coated with the sauces.

Add vegetables such as sliced carrots, peas, and bell peppers to the skillet, continuing to stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once everything is heated through and well combined, remove from heat.

Serve the Nasi Goreng hot, garnished with fried shallots for crunch, and accompanied by cucumber slices, tomato slices, or fresh cilantro for additional freshness. Lime or lemon wedges on the side can provide a tangy contrast. Nasi Goreng is best enjoyed immediately while hot, offering a delicious blend of savory flavors and textures in every bite.</p>
