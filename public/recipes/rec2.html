                        <p id="inst">Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside. Add the spaghetti to the water and cook according to the pack instructions. Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. Melt the butter in a deep frying pan, then add the pancetta and garlic. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. Take the pan of spaghetti off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and pancetta, and toss together. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.</p>
